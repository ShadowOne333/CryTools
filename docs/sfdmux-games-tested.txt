= It gets somewhere:
	- F-Zero GX (GC)
		ADX Audio
		Video fades in and then out, no sound
		
	- Sonic Unleashed (Xbox 360)
		AIX Audio
		No multi-lang, video skips and no audio present when using AIX.
		It does work with single ADX audio track though.
		
	- Resident Evil: The Darkside Chronicles (Wii)
		ADX Audio
		Audio is present, no video.
		Mpeg1 stream has some kind of header at the top of each packet.
		When copy-pasted to muxed sfd it shows a corrupted, static frame.
		Probably something I don't know how to write yet using FFmpeg.
	
	- Sonic Heroes (GC)
		ADX Audio
		Needs `SofdecStream` header I think, not `SofdecStream2`.
		Video plays.
